          <p>
            I am a historian of medicine, public health, gender, and religion in
            the modern United States.

            My current project, Beyond Better Babies: Religion and Eugenic
            Maternalism in Progressive Era Child Welfare explores the role of
            domestic science, religion, and eugenic thought and practice in
            Progressive Era public health and child welfare. I center my
            analysis on a lesser-known movement aimed to complement eugenics by
            addressing the conditions in which women were having children and
            raising future generations by controlling the environment through
            hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition. I focus on the New York City
            Babiesâ€™ Welfare Association (BWA), a city-wide preventative care
            network for immigrant women and children made up of hundreds of
            philanthropic, religious, and city-funded organizations. In treating
            child welfare reformers as public health workers, my dissertation
            demonstrates the ways eugenic environmental reform permeated public
            health programs.
