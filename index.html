                    I am a doctoral candidate in the History of Science department
                    at Harvard University. My research focuses on the history of 
                    medicine, public health, gender, and religion in the modern 
                    United States.

                    My dissertation explores the role of euthenic programming in 
                    Progressive Era urban child welfare and maternal reform. While 
                    eugenics is the subject of extensive historiography, I center 
                    my analysis on euthenics, a lesser-known movement among women 
                    that addressed the existing conditions in which people were 
                    reproducing and raising future generations by controlling the 
                    environment through hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition. I focus 
                    on the New York City Babiesâ€™ Welfare Association (BWA), a 
                    city-wide preventative care network for immigrant women and 
                    children made up of hundreds of philanthropic, religious, and 
                    city-funded organizations. In treating child welfare reformers 
                    as public health workers, my dissertation demonstrates the ways 
                    eugenic environmental reform permeated public health programs.
