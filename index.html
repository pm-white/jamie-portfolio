          <p>
            I am a historian of medicine and a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at
            the Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life at Columbia
            University. My current project examines the role of domestic
            science, religion, and eugenics in Progressive Era public health and
            child welfare. I hold a PhD from Harvard University, an MA from the
            University of Chicago, and a BA from the University of Portland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve published work stemming from my research for academic and
            public audiences, including in the Bulletin of the History of
            Medicine, The New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the Gilded
            Age and Progressive Era, Teen Vogue, Nursing Clio, and The American
            Historian.
          </p>
          <p>
            My research has been supported by fellowships from various
            institutions, including the New York Academy of Medicine, the
            American Philosophical Society, the Charles Warren Center for
            American Studies, the Committee on the Study of Religion at Harvard
            University, and the Consortium for the History of Science,
            Technology and Medicine.
