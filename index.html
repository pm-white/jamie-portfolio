            I am a historian of medicine and a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at
            the Institute for Religion, Culture and Public Life at Columbia
            University. My work examines the role of domestic science, religion,
            and eugenic thought and practice in Progressive Era public health
            and child welfare.
          </p>
          <p>

            American Studies, the Committee on the Study of Religion at Harvard
